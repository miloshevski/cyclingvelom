      <h1>History of VELO-M</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="period">
          <h2>1990-2000</h2>
          <p>
            The history of the club begins with its establishment in 1993 in
            Kumanovo. The club was founded by brothers Aleksandar and Marjan
            Petrovski, who were then prominent active cyclists and both held the
            title of Republic Champions of Macedonia.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even in its early years, the club achieved significant results.
            Notably, in 1993, the club organized the International Race -
            Macedonia '93, which evolved into the Tour of Macedonia in
            subsequent years. In the first edition of this race, the club won
            the yellow jersey.
            <br />
            <br />
            The club also became involved in organizing the October 11 race,
            which had been held since 1945. By taking over the race, the club
            actively organized it every year, with almost every edition
            featuring an international character. In 2018, a record number of
            cyclists from Macedonia, Serbia, and Bulgaria participated.
            <br /><br />
            In 1994, the club traveled to France in its first year of existence
            and established a partnership with the French club Louison Bobet in
            Rennes. There, the club participated in the Race Around Brittany
            with Marjan Petrovski, Aleksandar Petrovski, Slave Manevski, Panche
            Shaltevski, and Goran Mishkov.
            <br /><br />
            In its early years, the club actively participated in domestic races
            as well as on the international stage, including the Tour of Serbia,
            the Tour of Vojvodina, the Tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgrade
            - Budapest, Belgrade - Budapest - Bratislava, the Race Around
            Pomoravlje, the Grand Prix Gemenc, and the Grand Prix Chepel in
            Hungary.
            <br /><br />
            Significant results in the first decade were achieved by Marjan and
            Aleksandar Petrovski in the senior category, while Slave Manevski
            stood out in the junior category—who later became a Balkan legend
            and is still remembered in cycling races today. Another notable
            cyclist who quickly gained recognition on the international scene
            was Stojche Lazarov from Kochani.
            <br /><br />
            In the national championship, the club earned several titles as the
            Winner of the Ranking List.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="period">
          <h2>2000-2010</h2>
          <p>
            With the start of the new millennium, the club kept pace with
            significant events in the country. After the end of the conflict in
            2001, the club organized a major international cycling race for
            Peace and Friendship between Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. The
            race went smoothly, with Slave Manevski securing a stage victory,
            while Veli Sadiki finished third on the stage from Kumanovo to
            Tetovo.
            <br /><br />
            In the following years, the club strengthened with cyclists from
            Bulgaria and participated in significant races, including the Balkan
            Tour, where cyclist Georgi Drumov secured second place, and the Tour
            of Macedonia, where cyclist Vladimir Koev - Pirana won first place
            and the yellow jersey.
            <br /><br />
            In 2006, the club participated as a mixed team in the Tour of
            Turkey, considered one of the leading races in the region, and won
            the yellow jersey with cyclist Ivailo Gabrovski.
            <br /><br />
            These significant results helped elevate the sport and bring forth
            new promising cyclists. Coaches Marjan and Aleksandar Petrovski, who
            ended their careers as athletes, completed their physical education
            degrees and continued working in the sport as coaches. During this
            period, successful results were achieved by Stefan Cvetanovski,
            Srecko Jovchevski, Igor Petkovic, and Sase Velichkovski—who won
            numerous races in Macedonia and later became the first Macedonian
            cyclist to join the professional continental team Miche, an
            Italian-Bulgarian team.
            <br /><br />
            Stefan Petrovski also began his career during this period, quickly
            rising to prominence from his very first race and remaining a top
            cyclist to this day. Stefan is considered one of the best cyclists
            in Macedonian history and holds the most titles as National Champion
            of Macedonia.
            <br /><br />
            In 2007, Stefan Petrovski participated in the EJF (European Youth
            Olympic Festival) and later became the first Macedonian cyclist to
            join the world cycling center – UCI in Aigle, Switzerland, where he
            continued to build his career. He spent two years there, actively
            participating in major races in Switzerland, France, Italy, and
            competing in European and World Championships. While Stefan was
            competing in Switzerland, significant results were achieved by
            cyclist Predrag Gelevski, who also made an impact on the
            international scene, winning a sprint race in Dobrich, Bulgaria,
            against strong competition.
            <br /><br />
            Upon Stefan's return from Switzerland, the club was built around
            him, and together with him, it participated in domestic and
            international races. Notable results were achieved by Aleksandar
            Atanasovski, Yahi Ibishi, and Predrag Gelevski. During this time,
            two significant cyclists, Nikola Gjukić and Andrej Petrovski, also
            began their careers, leaving a lasting mark on Macedonian cycling.
            <br /><br />
            Andrej Petrovski briefly competed in Macedonia in the cadet category
            before moving to Germany, where he continued to build his career
            with several different German clubs. He later became the second
            cyclist to join the world cycling center UCI. Andrej stayed there
            for three years and achieved historic results that are of great
            significance for Macedonia and the club Velo-M. From UCI, Andrej
            continued his career with the Monaco Royal Club, where, during his
            two seasons, he won a bronze medal at the Olympic Games for small
            countries representing Monaco.
            <br /><br />
            Andrej Petrovski is a regular and record-holding Macedonian
            participant in European and World Championships. At the National
            Championships of Macedonia, Andrej is the National Champion in road
            cycling for the years 2018, 2019, and 2022, and National Champion in
            Time Trial for 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="period">
          <h2>2010-2020</h2>
          <p>
            From 2012 to 2016, the club dominated Macedonian cycling, winning
            most of the races, National Championships, and participating on the
            international stage in races such as Mersin, Ankara Tour, Serbia
            Tour, and Belgrade-Banja Luka. During this time, the unbeatable trio
            in the senior category consisted of Stefan Petrovski, Nikola Gjukić,
            and Ivica Davidovski, while in the junior category, Denis Kolevski
            won all races in all disciplines, with Mario Petrovski as the second
            best.
            <br /><br />
            Predrag Dimevski, who had started his career in the 90s in the cadet
            category at Velo-M and was living in South Africa, returned to the
            club. Upon his return, he became the National Champion in Road
            Cycling in 2013, and again in 2021, representing Velo-M.
            <br /><br />
            In 2016, the club experienced a transition with Stefan Petrovski
            moving to a German club. At that time, the club was the National
            Champion on the Ranking List, with key cyclists Nikola Gjukić, Mario
            Petrovski, Denis Kolevski, Ivica Davidovski, and Ivica Gatzovski. In
            the upcoming season, Nikola Lefkov and Kiril Markovski joined the
            club.
            <br /><br />
            2017 is considered one of the most significant years in the club's
            recent history, as the club expanded and signed sponsorship deals
            with Asian brands: Ranking – Helmets, Lameda – Equipment, Winspace –
            Bicycles, and FLR – Shoes, which strengthened the club's position.
            In 2017, the club participated for the first time in the Cyprus
            Tour, with the team consisting of Mario Petrovski, Nikola Gjukić,
            Nikola Lefkov, Ivica Davidovski, Denis Dobrev, and Hristomir Dobrev.
            <br /><br />
            Later that year, the club participated with a six-member team in the
            Albania Tour UCI 2.2, and some cyclists also competed in the
            national team of Macedonia in the Belgrade-Banja Luka and Serbia
            Tour races.
            <br /><br />
            With new legal regulations in 2018, the club partnered with the
            prominent Kumanovo-based company – Termalift, which specializes in
            the sale of forklifts and elevators. With the support received, the
            club was able to build and grow into a Balkan competitor. That year,
            the club was joined by Andrej Petrovski, who excelled on the Balkan
            scene and won an international race in Montenegro – the Kuci Trophy,
            which was held in two stages. Andrej managed to win both stages,
            earning the yellow jersey, polka-dot jersey, and white jersey.
            Later, Andrej also secured the title of National Champion in Road
            Cycling and Time Trial.
            <br /><br />
            In the same year, the club also participated in two races in
            Bulgaria – Dolchini Cup, and for the second time in the Cyprus Tour.
            <br /><br />
            In 2019, Andrej Petrovski, together with Velo-M, repeated the
            results from the previous season, becoming National Champion in Road
            Cycling and Time Trial once again, and winning the Kuci Trophy in
            Montenegro with even stronger competition, including Jaka Primozic
            from Slovenia and Dusan Rajovic from Serbia. The club also
            participated in several races of the Dolchini Cup in Bulgaria that
            year.

        <div class="period">
          <h2>2020-NOW</h2>
          <p>
            In 2020, the club underwent significant changes with the emergence
            of a new generation of cyclists, including Aleksandar Miloshevski,
            Nemanja Paunovski, Valentino Petkovski, David Georgievski, Jovan
            Mitev, Leon Miletić, Ivan Ilijevski, and many others. Despite the
            pandemic, these new cyclists took up the sport, with some developing
            a passion for it and achieving considerable success. The club also
            signed several important sponsorship deals, including with Kipeo – a
            company that produces equipment and continues to support the club.
            In addition to Kipeo, the club was sponsored by Yaban chains,
            Santik, and Sidebike shoes.
            <br /><br />
            This generation of Velo-M is one of the most significant in the
            club's history, and the results speak for themselves. From 2020 to
            2023, the club excelled in the categories of cadets, juniors, and
            seniors across all disciplines, including road, mountain, and
            cyclocross cycling. The cyclists won a significant portion of the
            National Championships in all disciplines.
            <br /><br />
            In 2021, the club became the one with the most trophies, totaling
            around 15. The same year, the club won the Albania Tour and became
            the first Macedonian club to win the yellow jersey (Dushan
            Veselinovic) in a race of such a rank. The team consisted of Dushan
            Veselinovic, Gregor Cerny Matija, Aleksandar Miloshevski, Jovan
            Mitev, Stevan Klisuric, with Marjan Petrovski and Mario Petrovski
            leading the team.
            <br /><br />
            Notable results from this period include second place in the
            Dolchini Cup – Bulgaria (Nemanja Paunovski), third place in the
            Dolchini Cup (Valentino Petkovski), third place in a race in
            Vojvodina (Valentino Petkovski), and third place in the 2023 Balkan
            Championship in mountain biking in Romania (Aleksandar Miloshevski).
            <br /><br />
            In 2024, the club celebrates its 31st anniversary, and it's
            challenging to summarize everything in just a few sentences. We take
            this opportunity to thank everyone who has been part of Velo-M from
            its inception to today. We continue forward!
